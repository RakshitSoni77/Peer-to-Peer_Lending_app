# 🤝 Peer-to-Peer Lending App

## 📘 Project Description
Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Lending App is a decentralized application (dApp) that connects borrowers and lenders directly on-chain. The platform enables users to create loan requests, supply liquidity, and handle repayments transparently through smart contracts — removing intermediaries and reducing counterparty risk.

## 🌍 Project Vision
To build an open, trustless marketplace where individuals can obtain and provide loans with transparent terms, automated repayments, and fully auditable on-chain records — empowering financial inclusion and lowering borrowing costs.

## ⚙️ Key Features
- 📝 Create loan requests with principal, interest rate, and duration  
- 💸 Lenders fund loans directly and receive on-chain interest payments  
- ⏱️ Automated repayment schedule and overdue handling via smart contracts  
- 🔒 Collateralisation support (optional) to reduce default risk  
- 📊 On-chain transparency: all loans, repayments and statuses visible to participants  

## 🚀 Future Scope
- 🖼️ Integration with tokenised collateral (NFTs, tokenised real-world assets)  
- 🔁 Partial funding and secondary market for loan tokens (transferable IOUs)  
- 🌐 Cross-chain lending pools and interest rate aggregation  
- ⚖️ On-chain dispute resolution and credit scoring oracles  
- 📈 Dashboard + analytics for lenders’ portfolio performance
