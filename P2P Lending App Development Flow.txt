Short Development Flow for Blockchain-based Peer-to-Peer Lending App

1. Define Concept & Requirements
   - Identify core features: user registration, credit scoring, lending requests, loan smart contracts, repayment tracking, etc.
   - Decide blockchain type: Ethereum, Polygon, or Solana (depending on speed, cost, and scalability).

2. Design System Architecture
   - Frontend: React.js / Next.js
   - Backend: Node.js / Express
   - Smart Contracts: Solidity (for Ethereum-compatible chains)
   - Database: IPFS (for decentralized storage) + MongoDB/PostgreSQL (for off-chain metadata)

3. Develop Smart Contracts
   - Core contracts:
     - LoanContract (borrower-lender agreement)
     - TokenContract (for stablecoin or native tokens)
     - CreditScoring (optional on-chain credit logic)
   - Implement key functions: requestLoan(), fundLoan(), repayLoan(), disputeResolution().

4. Integrate Frontend with Blockchain
   - Use Web3.js / Ethers.js to connect frontend with smart contracts.
   - Enable wallet connection via MetaMask or WalletConnect.

5. Implement Backend Logic
   - Handle user data, KYC (if needed), transaction tracking, and notifications.
   - Use oracles (like Chainlink) for real-world data (e.g., interest rates).

6. Testing
   - Unit testing (Hardhat/Truffle)
   - Testnet deployment (Goerli/Polygon Mumbai)
   - Security audit of smart contracts

7. Deployment
   - Deploy smart contracts on mainnet
   - Host frontend (Vercel/Netlify)
   - Run backend APIs on cloud (AWS/Render)

8. Launch & Monitor
   - Integrate analytics, track transaction performance, and improve UI/UX.
   - Enable DAO-based governance (optional for community control).
